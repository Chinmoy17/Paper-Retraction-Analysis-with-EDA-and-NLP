## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, duplicates, and feature scaling.
- **Text Analysis**: Extracts linguistic and contextual features from abstracts.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements multiple classifiers (e.g., SVM, Random Forest).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Generates plots to interpret model results and feature importance.

## Dataset

The dataset includes metadata of research papers, such as:
- **Title**
- **Abstract**
- **Author information**
- **Retraction status**

### Cell 7: Results Section

## Results

The analysis demonstrated the following:
- **Best Classifier**: Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 92%.
- **Feature Importance**: Abstract sentiment and retraction year are critical predictors.
